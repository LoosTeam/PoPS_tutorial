# Tutorial for running PoPS on Esrum
PoPS is a gene prioritization method that can be applied to GWAS summary statistics. You can find the official Github [here](https://github.com/FinucaneLab/pops), and the publication [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-023-01443-6).

PoPS has been made availble as an environment module in the `loos_group-AUDIT` folder on Esrum. This tutorial describes how you can load PoPS and associated tools, and run the program from start to finish.
